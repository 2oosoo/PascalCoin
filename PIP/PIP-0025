## Summary

Allow a node that has been offline for a while an option to "Quick Sync".
 
## Motivation

Installing a fresh node will quickly sync becuase it downloads the SafeBox from the network. If a node is not fresh and has not synced in a while, the node will download the blockchain files and will take longer to sync. It has been known that deleting the files in the Data folder will force the node to retrieve the latest SafeBox instead of downloading blockchain files. This allows the node to sync quickly.

## Specification

Put a button on the main screen titled "Quick Sync". Clicking the button will delete files in the Data folder and allow the node to quickly sync. Advise to the user that this will delete all current history within the blockchain files. Allow user to click Yes/Confirm or No/Cancel to execute action.
 
## Rationale

A feature of this coin is that it syncs quickly, but if the node has been offline for some time, the sync takes longer. The removal of needing to download the blockchain files could relieve unncessary network congestion.
